# mouse_move

This is a simple project built with MinGW to simulate moving your mouse randomly 
and toggeling NUMLOCK key to keep you in an active status on programs like Slack 
or Microsoft Teams... if you need that for some reason :)

The `build.sh` script will generate the executable. When launched, a red mouse
icon will appear in your tray. Left click the tray icon to start random motion,
and left click it again to stop. A right click will close it, in case anyone 
tries to snoop. This program does not need to be installed, and can be run from
a USB drive (which can immediately be removed) if you are concerned about it

See [my blog post on this program](https://ben.land/post/2020/12/19/mouse-mover-work-from-home) for more information.
